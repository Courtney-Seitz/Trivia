Trivia Game 
Welcome to my small trivia game or quiz about bananas. It is written with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript/jQuery. 
The Questions are organized within the HTML file, and the functions for the buttons and scoring are withing the Javascript file. The game functions in a basoc fashion, whereby the user clicks a start button, first block of questions and answers appear, the user clicks the answer and the tallied score appears. The user then clicks the 'next' button to move on to the next question until the quiz is over. There are only 4 questions in this version.

#Wishlist
There were various functions I wanted to implement, but time and knowledge were limited. Some of the functionality I hope to add:
 - Provide separate categories
 - Provide a progress bar as game progresses
 - Provide a timer function
 - Provide a 'play again' button
 - Provide a 'clear selection' button
 - Provide a 'previous' button
 - Provide more questions
 - Have questions generate randomly
