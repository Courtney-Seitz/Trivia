Trivia Game 
Welcome to my small trivia game or quiz about bananas. It is written with HTML, CSS and jQuery. 
The Questions are organized within the JS file, along with the functions for the buttons and scoring. The game functions in a basic fashion, whereby the user clicks a start button, first block of questions and answers appear, the user clicks the answer and can advance to the next set of questions and answers by clicking the 'next' button. The user then continues select answers to click the 'next' button to move on to the next question until the quiz is over where the score appears anda  button to provide the option to 'play again'. There are only 8 questions in this version.
